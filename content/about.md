Hi, I'm Taz! I'm currently a rising senior at Colgate University where I am double majoring in computer science and applied mathematics. I've done some research work on computational biology, using a mix of statistical methods, machine learning and numerical cellular simulations. On the mathematical side I'm mostly interested in statistics; on the CS side, I like working on distributed and parallel computing, and learning about abstract concepts such as type theory, data structures, etc.
