Hi! My name is Tazmilur Saad and I am currently a junior at Colgate University, where I mostly study computer science and applied mathematics with some Japanese stuffed in between. I am an international student from Bangladesh where I grew up playing a lot of video games, fiddling around with computers and listening to punk and progressive rock. Since then I have diversified into lo-fi citypop and machine learning, and nowadays I spend most of my time working as an undergraduate research assistant answering questions in computational biology with a heavy focus on statistics, distributed computing and optimizing for large scale problems. I am primarily interested in working in the tech space for a quantitative field, where my interest in computers and mathematics can intersect. 

You can read about some of my projects here. 
- A GPU acelerated stochastic algorithm for simulating intercell interactions.
- Identifying genetic predispositions towards human mood disorders.
- Predicting factors that influence the spread of a particular heliobacterium.

I also post about some of the things I learn over the weeks. Maybe check them out!
